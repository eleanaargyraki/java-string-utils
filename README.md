\# Java Utilities (Coding Factory Practice)



This repository contains small Java utility classes created as part of the Coding Factory (AUEB) program.  

Each class demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming and basic algorithmic thinking.



\## Files



\### 1. StringUtils.java

Utility class for basic string manipulation:

\- `stringReverse(String s)` → reverses a string  

\- `toUpperCase(String s)` → converts to uppercase  

\- `isPalindromic(String s)` → checks if a string is a palindrome  



\### 2. MathHelper.java

Utility class for basic math operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.).  

Includes examples of static methods and error handling.



\## How to Run

Import the files into your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)  

and run the `Main.java` class to test their functionality.
